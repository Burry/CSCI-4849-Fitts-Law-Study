        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>
            Trackpad sensitivity and feedback has seen leaps in the last decade
            in terms of precision and control. But with the new transition
            towards thinner “ultrabook” laptops that have the power and
            capability of a regular laptop but without the bulk, there’s been a
            tendency to remove certain functions and replace them with tech
            that’s thinner and lighter. With trackpads, we see the loss of the
            separate button to click. Instead, manufacturers have cleverly made
            the trackpad the button resulting in two ways to select something
            using a trackpad. We tested the Fitts' law throughput of interaction
            via tapping on the trackpad to make a selection versus pressing down
            on the whole trackpad mechanism.

            Our method of testing was brief for this experiment, but our test
            results came from people who had a wide demographic in tech. Grant
            has primarily used Apple laptops his whole life so he had a more
            intuitive comfort with both tapping and pressing. Bryan was a PC
            user for a large portion of his life until he transition to Apple.
            Vamshi has never owned an Apple laptop and all but one of the
            laptops he’s owned have had a physical button to press. There was no
            order to the tests we conducted as every person was instructed to do
            the tests on their own time. All tests were conducted using the same
            software (Fitts test) with a 100% error margin and 5 tests being
            conducted per trial, with four trials per person per interaction
            type (tapping versus pressing). All tests were also conducted on an
            Apple laptop from within the last 3 years. Our results show that
            pressing to click consistently yielded higher throughputs across the
            board, despite the background of the test participants.
